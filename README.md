✅ What is a Silent Zone Detector?

A Silent Zone Detector is a mobile application that automatically detects when the user enters a specific location (zone)—like a library, classroom, hospital, meeting room, temple, or office—and switches the phone to silent mode without any manual action.
It uses:
GPS location
Geofencing
Phone’s sound profile control

This ensures that the phone does not ring loudly in places where silence is required.

✅ Why is a Silent Zone Detector important?
⭐ 1. Prevents disturbance
In many public places, even one loud phone ring can disturb everyone.
The app prevents accidental ringing and helps maintain a peaceful environment.

⭐ 2. Useful for students
In classrooms, labs, libraries — phones ringing causes distraction and often embarrassment.
Silent Zone Detector mutes the phone automatically.

⭐ 3. Useful in hospitals & offices
Hospitals require a quiet environment for patients, and offices need silence for meetings.
The app ensures the phone won’t ring at the wrong time.

⭐ 4. Saves time & effort

The app handles it automatically — no need to remember.

⭐ 5. Improves discipline and professionalism

✅ How does the Silent Zone Detector work? (Simple Explanation)
Step 1 — User adds a Silent Zone

The user selects:
Zone Name
Location (GPS)
Radius (area size)
This zone is saved in the app.

Step 2 — App continuously tracks the phone's location
The app checks:
“Is the phone currently inside any saved zone?”

Step 3 — If user enters a Silent Zone → phone switches to Silent Mode
The app automatically:
Mutes ringtone
Turns vibration ON or OFF (depending on setting)

Step 4 — If user exits the Silent Zone
The phone’s sound settings return to normal.
